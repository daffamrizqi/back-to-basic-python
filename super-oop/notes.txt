What can super() do for you?:
- Allows you to call methods of the superclass in your subclass
- The primary use case of this is to extends the functionality of the
  inherited methods
- In the next example, you will create a class cube that inherits from square
  and extends the functionality of .area() (inherited from the Rectangle class 
  through Square) to calculate the surface area and volume of a Cube instance
