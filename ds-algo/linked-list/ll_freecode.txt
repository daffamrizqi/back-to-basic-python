Advanteges of Linked List:
1. Bcs of the chain-like system of linked list, you can add and remove elements quickly. this also doesn't require
   reorganizing the data structure unlike arrays of lists. Linear data structures are often easier to implement using linked list
2. Linked lists also dont require a fixed size or initial sizee due to their chainlike structure

Disadvantages of linked list:
1. More memory is required when compared to an array. this is because you need a pointer (which takes up its own memory) to point
   you to the next element
2. Search operations in LL are very slow. Unlike array, you don't have the option of random access

When should use Linked List:
1. don't know how many items will be in the list (that is one of the advantages - ease of adding items)
2. don't need random access to any specific elements (unlike array, you cannot access an element at a particular index in a linked list)
3. you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list
4. You need constant time insertion/deletion from the list (unlike an array, you dont have to shift every other item in the list first)
